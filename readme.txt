Easily display the banner image of a plugin within your WordPress content.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the shortcode `plugin_banner`, so you can quickly and easily display the banner image from the WordPress.org repository for the given plugin slug.

For example, to display the banner image of Easy Digital Downloads you would use:
`[plugin_banner slug="easy-digital-downloads"]`

By default images are not linked but if you add `link=true` into the argument list the image will be clickable and take the visitor the plugin page in the WordPress.org plugin directory.
